Phasma Food v2
==============

The main objective of the PhasmaFOOD is to design and implement a multi-target food sensitive mini-portable system for on-the-spot food quality sensing and shelf-life prediction.

About
--------


This repository stores source code of the cloud platform backend for the PhasmaFOOD project solution.
The PhasmaFOOD system performs spectroscopy and photonics based sensing of parameters indicating food quality across three use cases: mycotoxin detection, food spoilage and shelf life, and food authenticity and adulteration. The system comprises smart sensing devices (NIR, UV/VIS spectrometers and CMOS camera with processing board), a dedicated mobile application and a cloud platform. It enables the collection of reference data sets or enhances existing ones. Furthermore, the system supports the training and validating of data analysis, decision making pipelines and performing food analysis. In addition, the platform is flexible and allows realization of further, aligned use cases and usage scenarios.
The PhasmaFOOD system can be used across food supply chains from farm to fork. Stakeholders may utilize the system to perform on the spot food safety and quality analysis based on the PhasmaFOOD use cases or create their own use cases based on the PhasmaFOOD technology.
The PhasmaFOOD cloud platform is the focal point of all sensory and contextual data coming from the PhasmaFOOD sensing device, the mobile application and 3rd party data sources. The cloud platform hosts the PhasmaFOOD cloud database with all reference data sets necessary for performing food analysis required by the project use cases. It operates data analysis pipelines and rule engine for reactive and proactive decision making.
